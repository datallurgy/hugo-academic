Mine sites include various different types and ages of vehicles, which makes the dispatcher's job of allocating the various vehicles very difficult in order to maximize production of material. In particular, different vehicles and different operators, handle route conditions, such as grade and curvature, differently. A swarm-based truck allocation system provided on each vehicle is able to independently provide suggestions for each vehicle's allocation based on the vehicle's operating capabilities and the operating capabilities and status of other vehicles passing thereby. The status and operating capabilities of the vehicles may be communicated to each other via an inexpensive communication network, e.g. Bluetooth, when the vehicles are in close proximity.
