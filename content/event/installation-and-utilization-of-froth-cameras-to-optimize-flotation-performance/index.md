title: Installation and Utilization of Froth Cameras to Optimize Flotation Performance
abstract: The Red Dog Mine in northwest Alaska is one of the worldâ€™s largest
  zinc producing mines. The heterogeneity of the ore body results in a
  significant amount of variability in the feed mineralogy and grade; this makes
  flotation optimization challenging. Froth cameras were initially installed in
  the lead and zinc rougher circuits in 2003 to help operators adjust the
  circuit for changes in feed grade in order to maximize recovery. System use
  declined as the camera and lighting technology became obsolete. The froth
  cameras were updated in early 2017 to LED illuminated, Internet-Protocol (IP)
  based cameras, in line with modern technology. These cameras constantly
  monitor the rougher circuit and collect data related to froth characteristics,
  such as color, texture, velocity, and stability, allowing for optimization of
  the circuit recovery. This presentation discusses the installation process,
  current utilization of the froth camera data, and future planned operation of
  froth cameras with an Expert system to optimize flotation circuit performance
  at the Red Dog Mine.
