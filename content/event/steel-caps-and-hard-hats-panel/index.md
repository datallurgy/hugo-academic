title: Steel Caps and Hard Hats Panel
abstract: Front Line Workers represent 80% of the global workforce. Despite
  their essential role in almost every industry, these workers have
  traditionally been underserved by technology. The overnight transition to
  remote work for office workers has demonstrated that our industry can adopt
  new ways of working powered by digital when motivated - how can we achieve
  this pace of innovation for our frontline operations where the action happens?
