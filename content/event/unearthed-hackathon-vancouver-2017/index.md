title: Flotation Optimization Using Froth Characteristics
abstract: Froth cameras have become a common technology in flotation circuits to
  collect key performance data in the minerals processing industry.  The
  information they collect can be used to optimize circuit performance and metal
  recovery through measurement of variables such as bubble size, froth depth and
  froth velocity.  Currently, very few of the actual parameters are used to make
  decisions while operating the circuit.  The challenge is to determine what the
  optimum flotation conditions would be based on all the data measurements
  available.

Currently, flotation circuit performance is driven by measured on-stream assays supported by operator observations of froth characteristics. Operator observations are subjective in nature (Is the froth slow? Dry? Too dark?) and inexperienced operators are typically unsure of their observations. In addition, operators cannot watch the circuit constantly as they have other duties to perform. The installed froth cameras allow for continuous monitoring of the cells and clear objective measurements of color, texture, collapse rate and other variables. Optimization of the flotation circuit could lead to USD 4.6 million revenue annually for every 0.5% increase in recovery at $1.10/lb. of zinc.
